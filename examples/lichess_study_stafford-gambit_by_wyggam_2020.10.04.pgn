1. e4 { ---Introduction---
Hi everyone. I've created this study both for people who wish to try the stafford gambit as black and for people who want to learn how to response properly to this gambit.
Be aware though that this opening is objectively unsound, and there are several ways to counter it with white and to get a significant advantage. If you play this opening you are essentially accepting a losing position in which you have to swindle your opponent to win. It's extremely fun but it's not a proper way to play chess.
If you are a beginner player looking to build an agressive repertoire as black against e4 this is not the way to do it.
However it is still extremely tricky and it is extremely easy for white to go wrong while playing seemingly solid moves.
It's a good surprise weapon for Blitz and bullet, especially if your main opening against e4 is the Petroff.
I've incorporated ideas from Eric Rosen, Jonathan Schrantz, Daniel Naroditsky and others as well as ideas of my own. Currently this line is undergoing a boom in popularity on the internet and new variations and tricks are often found. So I'll try to keep this study updated.
Don't forget to drop a like if you enjoyed it =) } 1... e5 { The Stafford Gambit is an e4-e5 opening that can occur in the russian game. } 2. Nf3 { [%cal Gf3e5] } 2... Nf6 3. Nxe5 { Here the main response is to drive the knight away and then recapture the pawn } { [%cal Gf6e4] } (3. Bc4 { Bc4 can lead to a reverse Stafford gambit } 3... Nxe4 4. Nc3 Nxc3 5. dxc3 { This is actually slightly better than the normal stafford gambit as white as an extra tempi. }) 3... Nc6!? { Black offers an exchange of knights. This trade is very favorable for white as it will damage Black's struture and give time to defend the e4 pawn. Therefore Back is sacrificing a pawn and in exchange will beneficiate from open diagonals for the bishops and a semi open file for the queen as well as a slight lead in development. However, if White plays accurately he should be able to come up on top of the ensuing struggle with its extra e pawn. } { [%cal Ge5c6] } (3... d6 4. Nf3 Nxe4 { The Petroff is considered as a very solid but also very placid way to response to e5. }) 4. Nxc6 { This move accepts the gambit. White is technically better and Black objective is now to try to trick white into blundering something. } (4. Nc3?! { White can get into a halloween Gambit by ignoring the knight. this is higly dubious. })  (4. Nf3 { White can refuse the gambit with either Knight back to f3 or d5. It's objectively a poor decision since in theory this gambit is dubious for black but it can happen. Then the position will revert to a normal Petroff position. Stafford players would be well advised to know these lines as well. } 4... Nxe4 5. Nc3 Nxc3 6. dxc3)  (4. d4) 4... dxc6 { Taking with d is better.

Black has many different traps and idea depending on how White decides to set his pieces up. It's fairly easy to fall into any of Black's tricks if White isn't well prepared. } (5. e5 Ne4 (5...
